Here are informations about the host/computer, and languages/versions used for tests:
```

```

The goal is to test two algorithm (sudoku backtracking) using different languages, to compare runtime speed.

- The [first](sudoku.py) is simple, and tests only 100 grids.
- The [second](optimized/sudoku.py) is an optimization of the first, and is a lot faster. So it can tests **all 1956 grids** !

## Simple Algo

For the first 100 grids : At each iteration, they will resolve the first hole of the grid, til no holes.
(*specialized* versions use all weapons available in language, while others use string and hashset)
```
%s
```

## Optimized Algo

For **all 1956** grids : At each iteration, they will firstly resolve the hole, with minimal choices, of the grid, til no holes.
(*specialized* versions use all weapons available in language, while others use string and hashset)
